# Usage: gotomd

Synchronize GitHub README.md files with Go source code,
documentation, tests, and command output. gotomd processes
Markdown templates or existing README files, replacing special
directives with content generated directly from your Go
codebase. This ensures your documentation is always accurate
and in sync with the source.

	gotomd [-v | --verbose ...] [-c | --clean] [-r | --replace]
	       [-l | --license] [-h | --help] [-f | --force] [-z | --colorize]
	       [-o | --output <dir>] [-u | --usage <filename>]
	       [-p | --permission <perm>] [path ...]

	[-v | --verbose ...]
	    Show detailed processing information.

	    Additional 'v's increase verbosity.


	[-c | --clean]
	    Reverse operation and remove generated markdown

	    (Cannot be used with the [-r | --replace] option).


	[-r | --replace]
	    Replace the *.MD in place

	    (Cannot be used with the [-c | --clean] option).


	[-l | --license]
	    Display license before program exits.


	[-h | --help]
	    Display program usage information.


	[-f | --force]
	    Do not confirm overwrite of destination.


	[-z | --colorize]
	    Colorize go test output.


	[-o | --output <dir>]
	    Direct all output to the specified directory.


	[-u | --usage <filename>]
	    Replace the usage section in the given Go source file using
	    content from standard input.  The section is identified as the
	    text between the first occurrence of '^\n/*\n# Usage .*$' and the
	    following package declaration.  This allows keeping command-line
	    usage output (e.g., from --help) synchronized with the package
	    documentation.


	[-p | --permission <perm>]
	    Permissions to use when creating new file.

	    (can only set RW bits)


	[path ...]
	    A specific gotomd file template with the extension '*.gtm.md' or a
	    directory which will be searched for all matching template
	    '*.gtm.md' files.  It defaults to the current directory: '.'
